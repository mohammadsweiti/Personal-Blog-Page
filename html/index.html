            Me and my friend Ahmed Sweiti, Designed and developed a Java
            Application to simulate a machine that make a coffee by applying the
            concepts of Object-oriented programming in the code and using Java
            Swing for designing simple user interface

          <p class="par2">
            Made the application as the project of Object-Oriented Programming

            I recently started learning front-end development through Udacity,
            and it's been an exciting journey. From understanding HTML and CSS
            to starting with JavaScript, I'm amazed at how much creativity and
            technical skill front-end development involves.

            also i started a full stack web development learing with sada
            company in my universtiy , so both give me what i need in front end

          <p class="par1">
            For my first big project, I decided to create a smart agriculture
            system using IoT components and cloud technology. I used sensors to
            measure soil moisture, temperature, and light levels, and then
            connected it to an Azure IoT Hub to collect data in real-time.
          </p>
          <p class="par2">
            It was a challenging project but very rewarding. I learned so much
            about cloud computing, data analysis, and how IoT can make farming
            more efficient. In this post, I'll share my process, challenges, and
            what I learned.
